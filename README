This is an early version of this.  

To use it get a Raspberry Pi (or any other computer) running a LAMP stack,
plug speakers into it.  Then stick these files in a directory on the web host.
Finally, set up a mysql database called radio and import radio.sql and change 
the username and password in settings.php to allow access to your database.

Then point a web browser at the host and control your radio from any web enabled
deivce on your local network.
